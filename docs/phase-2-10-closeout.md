# Phase 2.10 — Final production verification & closeout

Verification date: 2026-07-12
Branch: `phase-2-10-final-verification`

## Verdict

**NOT READY FOR PHASE 3** by the strict criteria of this checklist — two
items are blocked on access this environment does not have (see "Requires
manual action"). Everything verifiable from the repository is green.

Note on sequencing: the Phase 3 workspace-architecture commit (`26ae253e`)
already exists on `main`. This closeout verifies the 2.10 surface as it
lives on that main; no Phase 3 work was added here.

## Verified in this pass (Completed)

### Migration `20260712130000_create_investor_relations.sql` — static review
- Creates exactly the five tables the code reads
  (`project_investor_links`, `project_investor_events`, `project_risks`,
  `project_investor_questions`, `project_due_diligence_items`).
- Every column the application inserts/updates exists; the due-diligence
  upsert's `onConflict: 'user_id,project_id,group_key,item_key'` matches
  the migration's unique constraint exactly.
- RLS enabled on all five tables with owner-scoped SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/
  DELETE (events has no UPDATE policy — the code never updates events;
  public-viewer writes go through the service-role route only).
- Foreign keys to `auth.users` and `public.projects` (cascade), link FK
  `on delete set null`; `token_hash` unique; performance indexes on
  `(user_id, project_id)` (+ `created_at desc` for events/questions).
- Idempotent (29 `if [not] exists` guards), zero destructive statements,
  no impact on existing production data (all tables are new).

### Service-role key handling
- 11 references, all in API routes / server libs / `integrations/supabase/server.ts`;
  none in `'use client'` files or components.
- Built client bundles (`.next/static`) contain **zero** occurrences.
- Never logged, never returned in a response, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`-prefixed.
- Missing configuration returns a safe `503 not_configured` JSON error.

### Repository checks (all passing locally)
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm check:i18n`, `pnpm check:prod-endpoints` (after the fix below),
`pnpm check:public-env`, `pnpm test:run`, `pnpm build`,
`pnpm test:smoke` (public scope).

### Fix applied in this pass
- `src/app/api/auth/password-reset/request/route.ts`: the dev-only origin
  fallback hardcoded `http://localhost:3000`, failing
  `check:prod-endpoints`. It now falls back to the canonical trusted
  origin — strictly safer (never a caller-influenced or localhost URL)
  and the guard passes without any allowlist change.

## Smoke tests and GitHub CI findings

- Local `pnpm test:smoke` against the production build: **82 passed,
  22 skipped (provider/credential-gated), 16 failed.** Every failure
  asserts on LIVE market-provider state (e.g. "Data provider connected",
  the smart-analysis status heading, calendar lazy-load) — the identical
  suite passed twice earlier the same day on the same code; the upstream
  quote provider is throttling this machine after a full day of runs
  (`/api/recommendations` returns an empty quote payload while metadata
  reports available). These are environment-dependent tests, not
  regressions from this branch. Follow-up (separate task, not done here to
  avoid weakening coverage): make provider-live assertions accept the
  product's honest unavailable states.
- GitHub CI on `main` (`26ae253e`): 6 of 8 jobs pass (TypeScript, ESLint,
  i18n, unit/integration, build, Lighthouse). Failing:
  1. **Production launch guards** — `check:prod-endpoints` flagged the
     hardcoded localhost fallback in the password-reset route. **Fixed on
     this branch.**
  2. **Playwright smoke** — two compounding causes: the workflow installed
     only chromium while the config declares a mobile-webkit project
     (**fixed on this branch**: webkit now installed), and the same
     provider-live assertions above, which on GitHub-runner IPs are
     expected to hit provider blocks (documented follow-up).

## PR #3 CI result (final)

`phase-2-10-final-verification` → PR #3. Workflow jobs: **TypeScript,
ESLint, i18n, Production launch guards (fixed by this branch), Unit &
Integration tests, Production build, Lighthouse CI — all pass.**
Playwright smoke: 74 passed / 22 skipped / **22 failed**, with zero
webkit-executable errors (the webkit install fix works; that third of the
suite now genuinely runs). Every remaining failure is in the
provider-live family (terminal provider-state text across ar/en/fr,
calendar lazy-load, sharia research fetches, trader provider views, and
two webkit-only follow-ons) — pre-existing on every `main` run and
environment-dependent. Follow-up task: harden these assertions to accept
the product's honest unavailable states; do not merge the PR while the
smoke check is red unless that check is explicitly accepted as known-red.

## Requires manual action (Blocked here)

1. **Apply the migration** — this environment has no Supabase access
   token, no linked project, and no Docker for a local instance.
   Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → run
   `supabase/migrations/20260712130000_create_investor_relations.sql`
   (idempotent; safe to re-run), or `supabase db push` from a linked CLI.
2. **Configure the service-role key** — Vercel → Project Settings →
   Environment Variables → add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-side
   only, exact name, no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix), then redeploy.
3. **Provide E2E credentials** — `E2E_USER_EMAIL`, `E2E_USER_PASSWORD`,
   `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` as GitHub Actions secrets (the
   smoke workflow already forwards them) and locally for authenticated
   Playwright runs. Until then the credential-gated launch-readiness test
   self-skips and authenticated/admin flows remain **untested**, not failed.

## Requires production verification (after the manual steps)

- Investor links end-to-end: create → open → password gate → expiry →
  revocation → activity log rows → questions.
- Cross-user isolation against real rows (RLS policies are owner-scoped by
  design; verify with two real accounts).
- Admin flows and `/sfm-admin-control` with a real admin account.
- Authenticated visual QA (AR/EN/FR × light/dark × mobile widths) for
  signed-in pages; public-scope QA was completed in earlier phases.
